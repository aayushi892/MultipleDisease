# Multiple Disease Prediction using Supervised Machine Learning

## Overview

This project aims to develop a robust predictive model capable of diagnosing multiple diseases based on patient health data. Leveraging supervised machine learning techniques, the model analyzes various health indicators to identify potential diseases, thereby assisting healthcare professionals in making informed decisions. 

## Objectives

- **Data Collection**: Gather a comprehensive dataset containing various health metrics and corresponding disease labels.
- **Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, outliers, and categorical variables.
- **Model Development**: Implement multiple supervised learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines) to train the model.
- **Model Evaluation**: Assess model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- **Visualization**: Provide visual insights into the data and model predictions through various plots and charts.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is sourced from [insert source, e.g., Kaggle, UCI Machine Learning Repository], containing features such as:

- Patient demographics (age, gender, etc.)
- Health indicators (blood pressure, glucose levels, etc.)
- Disease labels (e.g., diabetes, hypertension, heart disease)

## Installation

To get started, clone this repository and install the required packages:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/multiple-disease-prediction.git
cd multiple-disease-prediction
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the following command to execute the model training:

```bash
python train_model.py
```

After training, you can make predictions on new patient data by executing:

```bash
python predict.py --data new_patient_data.csv
```

## Results

The model's performance is evaluated and documented in the `results/` directory, including:

- Model accuracy
- Confusion matrix
- ROC curve

## Future Work

Future enhancements may include:

- Incorporating additional features for improved accuracy
- Implementing advanced algorithms such as Neural Networks
- Developing a user-friendly web interface for real-time predictions
